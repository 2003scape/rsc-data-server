Greetings my young adventurers, and a warm welcome to all of you. As I look down upon the world that I created, I feel a strong sense of joy that it is now home to so many men and women of curious minds and adventurous spirits. I am also saddened to see that it is prey to so much death and destruction, and I can only assume that my brother Zamorak enjoys a large following on this small planet. Perhaps in time these mortals will learn of ways to co-exist harmoniously with their fellow humans. But for now I am sure that they will continue to hack each others heads off with large metal implements.

But it is often said that the tongue can be sharper than the blade, and this might explain the latest development from the secular powers that be. Although their wisdom may be less than infinite, there can be no doubt that the council has performed a small miracle in their creation of the snapshot- the latest way to report abuse. This pleases me greatly, for slander is the point when pride and stupidity converge. When a human disrespects another life, he disrespects his own.

<a href="/images/book-candle.png"><img class="rsc-image" src="/images/book-candle.png" align="left" /></a>
It all became too much for the mage known as Andrew, whose ability to manipulate time means that these foul-mouthed roughians can now be caught red-handed by snapshot- even after they have perpetrated their crime. The alchemy of reversal is then performed, with said mage adding injury to insulter.

<div style="clear:both"></div>

<a href="/images/runestone.jpg"><img class="rsc-image" src="/images/runestone.jpg" align="right" /></a>
Having abused the gift of speech, those brash youths are rewarded by having their tongue removed, a practise still favoured by the Mehkmets of Al Kharid. Those who truly revel in their idiocy may even find that they are excommunicated from Runescape altogether. At this point in time it would seem that 439 such wayward fellows have already been permanently banned from our great land, with another 995 receiving a blackmark against their name.

<div style="clear:both"></div>

I of course know that snapshot has proved popular with you young adventurers. Indeed, some have been falling over themselves to report abuse from their fellow humans, often indirectly reporting themselves in the process! Weakened by their own runestones, you might say. So in the ongoing war against malice, let us not ourselves malicious be. After all, any warrior who hopes to conquer great foes must first be a creature of great courage, and possibly not the sort of person who would be offended by the word ''noob''...

And so onto your own hopes and prayers. It seems many of you yearn for the creation of a four-legged riding creature, commonly referred to as a horse. In my all encompassing benevolence I would say that this is not necessarily such a bad idea. But alas I have divined that horses would be less than happy about living on Runescape. Her rocky terrain and dried-out soil would not provide adequate footing for an animal that must support the weight of a human on its back. Maybe one day the evolutionary conditions could change, but don''t start getting excited - Runescape wasn''t built in a day you know...

Equally popular is the desire for a mine which contains anvils and a furnace. "Why can''t you have a mine with anvils and a furnace?" you cry, "then each adventurer could advance their levels really easily." The answer of course is simple. If you had a mine with anvils and a furnace, then each adventurer could advance their levels really easily. Come on now you slothful creatures. First you want an animal to cart you around on its back, and then you want an infinite supply of superior weaponry!

You must know that a hero''s status is not chosen or acquired; it is carved into the sheer rock face of hard graft and toil!

And on that note I must return to my other creations. Just remember that hard work is always its own reward. And you get to cast some pretty good spells as well.

<div style="clear:both"></div>

Firstly, I must say that I was touched by the level of response to my first letter. Truly I say that Runescape is home to such a myriad of peoples, including some that now transcend the more traditional etiquette of grammar and punctuation. But above all I was struck by the sincerity of your words- it is a great thing indeed to live with such a strong sense of hope.

I have received a huge number of messages, so I alas cannot reply to every single one here. But how pleased Saradomin was to hear from men and women with such strong, seeking minds!

One fellow writes:

> Firstly, and, methinks, my best idea, is to make daggers throwable. The advantage? A dagger packs more punch than an arrow (conceivably) and one would not find it necessary to carry a bow. This would also provide an actual use for daggers, whereas before they were the weapon of a noob or someone driven quite insane on the apothecary''s latest experiment. Those who fancy themselves the dashing thief would be quite glad to be able to wield daggers, the thief''s weapon of lore. The better the dagger (bronze as opposed to rune) the more damage it would do.

*Corande, AKA Justin.*

<a href="/images/dwarf.jpg"><img class="rsc-image" src="/images/dwarf.jpg" align="right" /></a>
An interesting idea, a dagger that can be thrown- something that you would only do, I presume, in order to defend yourself. I can confirm that plans are now afoot to give knives the gift of flight, and that this action will be part of the ranged skill series. Unlucky recipients of said knives will then find their health to be substantially lessened. These weapons will not, however, be stackable, so sadists will have to find other ways to satiate their Zamorockian urges.

<div style="clear:both"></div>

I was, of course, gratified to learn that so many of you are indeed committed to the hard graft and toil that I spoke of last time. Or as one adventurer puts it:

<blockquote class="rsc-centre-text">Oh great and powerful Saradomin. I beg of thee. Please grant me an Idiot Repelling Amulet so that I can work in peace and not be bugged for hours by children who covet what I have worked so hard to achieve. Why must I repeatedly state that I am not selling some piece of armor or weapon over and over again?</blockquote>

*Your Humble Servant,*

*Jerichoholic.*

Others were motivated by a desire for justice, fervently demanding that certain secular decisions be overturned at once. Rather than engaging with those who would seek to Support their Custom, it would seem that the sheer passion of these individuals got the better of them... so they pestered me instead. But Runescape does have a process of evolution, and I am sure that it will be reaching them soon.

But if you need customer support, please use the customer support forms! And so back to business.

<blockquote class="rsc-centre-text">My Lord, long have I worshipped your greatness. I wander the lands preaching your wisdom to the masses, hoping to enlight even one mind. "Bury your bones", I proclaim to the huddled masses. "Saradomin is with you" I announce to any great warriors I see. Day and night I strive to raise my prayer level, hoping, it will will bring me closer to your all encompassing light. It is the purpose that drives me, it is the will that binds me, it is my reason for being on this world (Runescape). And so I ask you, might you create another quest that raises prayer? Much would be the rejoicing if this came to be.</blockquote>

*Your loyal servant, tom505*

<p class="rsc-centre-text">Now certain members of the council are seeking out new ways to level your prayer skill. Perhaps by way of a quest. Not that I would ever intervene directly into the affairs of RuneScape of course...</p>

Another adventurer complained of tiredness from too much standing.

> Greetings oh Mighty One... Whilst one understands that questioning the way in which You (in your infinite wisdom) have created Runescape is liable to cause offence and thus painful injury to the interrogator - the ache in one''s legs is such that the question can no longer be withheld. In essence - your servant has been whacking the living daylights out of monsters, picking flax ''til her fingers bleed, pounding rocks and baking like there is no tomorrow, for day upon endless day and now finds herself exhausted, with varicose veins and blisters. Oh for the blessed relief of a nice little sit down with one of brother Galahad''s cups of tea, or ...miracle of miracles...a sleep! Those tempting looking beds with their \*nice blankets\* ..those \*sturdy looking chairs\*. One wonders why You created these taunting items of furniture when Your subjects cannot use them? One is sure there must be a perfectly good reason but not being a mighty god such as yourself (grovel) one cannot think of it.

<em class="rsc-centre-text">Lise</em>

> P.S. If one must be turned into an imp for this impertinence please let it not be on Karamja - walking on hot laval rock would play havoc with my bunions...

Now as the god of all things good, there are some matters which simply demand my full and undivided attention. This was not one such matter. But you did arouse my sympathies- even the gods feel weary sometimes you know.

But the question on nearly everyone''s lips was when that of when our world would enter a new dimension. Gazing across to the mage Andrew - for we are not one and the same- I see that three-dimensional landscapes are now under construction. There is still much work to be done of course. When you seek to change the world, you take on every blade of grass. Carpentry has for this reason been postponed until after the updates.

This will doubtless prove disappointing to some, but then even the gods can''t please everyone. In the words of one adventurer:

> "I got told by a friend the Runescape graphics are going to turn into really good graphics... if this is true, don''t do it, as it would wreck the game."

Oh how I laughed. Even the Andrew was said to have managed a smile- which is no mean feat I can tell you.

All in all I can see that these are happy times for the people of Runescape. The perpetrators of deceit are being hounded out, with over 60 scam sites being taken down in the last week. The new combat level display has proved popular amongst merchant types, with traders now having to try really hard to get ripped off. Perhaps my presence has tipped the balance of power away from all those who would promote evil.

Or maybe it''s just been a good week. Until next time my friends.

<div style="clear:both"></div>

A warm welcome to one and all,

And so it is that time again when I respond to your many questions regarding this wonderful land of ours. The good god of Runescape has been feeling a bit under the weather this week, so I''ll cut to the chase.

> Greetings great Saradomin. I am a great worshipper amongst you. You have made this world beautiful and as great as can be. However, there are many people that do not follow your religion. This is due to the large lack of people who bury bones. The world of Runescape needs a new bone, that will draw them ever closer to your spirituality. The solution to this, is dragon bones. As you know, dragons are the most grand of all foes in Runescape. Few warriors are able to slay these beasts of almighty power. But those who do should be especially awarded with dragon bones. With dragon bones your number of worshippers will increase beyond believe! And the evil powers of your brother Zamorak shall not stand a chance against the holy spiritual powers on the plane of Runescape. Please Saradomin, the fate of Runescape can not fall into Zamorak''s hands.

*Kormyr*

Hmm... Zamorak''s not that bad you know - actually he''s worse! But he is still my brother, even if he can''t be bothered to keep in touch these days. I do agree about the bones though. This was a popular request, and I can tell you that they should be available within the next week! So consider your prayers answered, and get on down to your nearest dragon.

> Dear Saradomin,

> After hitting big bars of metal all day with my trusty hammer, i suddenly thought: "I wish i could wack someone over the head with this". Then an idea came to me. Why not create mighty war-hammers to blight thy enemies with. Higher power than axes and even less aim....wow. The different metals could all be used to make them and I think they would be a welcome new weapon to all us rune -scapers out there on the battlefields. Your faithfull warrior,

<a href="/images/warhammer.jpg"><img class="rsc-image" src="/images/warhammer.jpg" align="right" /></a>
Well it''s good to see such enthusiasm for one''s work. But I''m afraid that your desires are not aligned with the greater scheme of things- we''re trying to expand people into 3D, whilst you''re trying to flatten them out! But certainly you have been successful in lodging your words into my brain, so maybe in the far distant future...

And so onto that most controversial of subjects - money. It appears that begging is still something of a problem in the world of Runescape, with many a hard-working player still being plagued by requests for free stuff. Fortunately there are a few truly civic minded young persons who believe in the concept of paying people for all their hard-work.

<div style="clear:both"></div>

> The people of Runescape have been aquiring a lot of wealth while the good bankers of Runescape keep our belongings safely stored in their vaults and never asked anything in return.

> Isn''t it time we citizens do something back and pay some interest on what we keep in our banks?

*Dalen-Van.Andre*

<a href="/images/skull-coin.jpg"><img class="rsc-image" src="/images/skull-coin.jpg" align="left" /></a>
I am happy to say that those who tend the banks are in fact paid by the state, that most generous of organisations which so nobly provides for the welfare of so many institutions.

But Mr.Dalen-Van, I nonetheless salute you in your desire to reward those people who work so hard for the benefit of others. How horrified you would be to learn of some more advanced beggars, who would seem to want the whole world for nothing...

<div style="clear:both"></div>

> "Why can''t you make all runescape for everybody for free, those member signs are very annoying please make every thing free."

*Voldemort 45*

One individual even asked me how it feels to be "the first god that requires money to sustain your world." This confused me somewhat, as to my knowledge, Runescape is one of the largest free-worlds of its'' kind, with at least one hundred hours of free quests and things to do.

I''ve received a few notes from Runescapers who "feel left out" of the members game and wish they could access the new features. The answer to is of course... ..become a member! To quote a certain fellow from the Council of Runescape...

> We currently need to concentrate on continued development for the membership servers as membership subscriptions pays for all support services (for free players as well), the running costs of all the machines(including free servers), staff wages (who help support free servers) and the development costs of new quests, skills and future technology.
>
> Please remember that the game was free for over a year before membership was even suggested. The fact that we''re keeping so many free servers online now is a testament to the goodwill Jagex has towards the many thousands of free RuneScape players. The US\$5 monthly membership price is very reasonable considering how much entertainment you''re getting. A cinema visit would give, at most, 2-3 hours of entertainment - RuneScape offers so much more than that!
>
> Why not consider becoming a member and help support the continued development of the game?

I couldn''t have put it better myself.

But you cannot put a price on compassion, and so I am by no means deaf to your cries...

> Greetings, As one of those many residents of your realm living in poverty, I often find myself wondering: Will these new graphics be available for even the poorest of RuneScape citizens? And what if the citizen is using a rustic system to run RuneScape on? What affect will these new and grand updates have upon us misfortunates? Your friend and follower,

*Sir Justin*

And I am happy to announce that the answer is an emphatic yes! Non-members will certainly be going 3-D, and what''s more, there won''t be any increased lag as a result. So let''s give three cheers to the mage Andrew - living proof that the best things in life are indeed free. Which reminds me...

> In all candor, I ask that thy might bringith a place for the learned; a library. This would prove useful for those of which wish to aquire great knowledge in the history of our great land. Perhaps if we were literate... we could forge our own tomes, portraying the history for thine self. Sending Blessings,

*Maro*

What a splendid idea. I know a building in Varrock that hasn''t seen a lot of action for a while. I''ll have a word with the council, I''m sure that they would be prepared to convert it- such is their commitment to public institutions.

Of course all we need now are some books. Histories, stories, even tales of elves; all these exist but they have been scattered somewhat in the chaos of the last age or so. So if anyone should stumble upon any of these, please feel free to pass them onto me.

<p class="rsc-centre-text"><a href="/images/knight-chalice.jpg"><img class="rsc-image" src="/images/knight-chalice.jpg" /></a></p>

Well, what a generous week it''s been. I feel better now. Perhaps we should finish on a poem.

> The Runescape World Made Of Might,
> Made Of Hard-Workers, Made To Fight.
> To Fight The Black Hearts Of Those Who Rebel,
> To Send Good To god, And Evil To Hell.

<div style="clear:both"></div>

> Dear Saradomin,

> I know there are a good amount of people who might know this question but I thought I might as well ask. I would like to know what the world of runescape was like when it was first created.

*Nick Petit*

Ah, a historian I see. Well I almost don''t know where to begin. Which is what I said at the time, in fact. But of course it all started with Lumbridge, and the good kingdom of Misthalin. But there was no Al Kharid or Draynor village, and Edgeville was pretty deserted, so people called it Ghost Town.

The world back then was a comparatively good place. People didn''t tend to wander around Lumbridge calling each other "noob", because everybody was one. Black knights were the toughest monsters, of which there were three.

The top equipment you could get was adamantite legs, mithril body,adamantite large helmet, adamantite long sword, and iron kite shield. There were no amulets.

Adventurers could, however, sink their teeth into six different quests: the Cook''s Assistant, the Restless Ghost, Demon Slayer, Shield of Arrav, Romeo and Juliet and Sheep Shearer.

The main skills were combat, ranged, mining and smithing. Cooking consisted only of cooking meat and bread making. Of course, families have always been divided over the issue of vegetables, and this was literally the case now, with many a warrior dropping dead from scurvy.

Mourning partners were in time told that there were plenty more fish in the sea, but this was of little consolation, as no-one knew how to fish yet. There was also no crafting, and Lumbridge''s traditional Sunday afternoon craft fairs were a bit of a let down as a result.

Music as an attack? It really would have to be offensively bad. But as for music in the game, that certainly will be coming. For some time now, a great man-minstrel by the name of Ian has been mincing away, to create great scores of majestic sounds that will one day delight your ears.

Behold, such robes exist for all to see! Take yourself to the monastery and speak to the good Abbott Langley who works there. And if you are of sufficient prayer level he will endow you with this most stylish of artefacts. Just don''t let him talk you into a haircut.

The second time I witnessed this person was near the Desert at Easter. At this time I said a friendly greeting to him and he responded with a similar greeting, and then disappeared, leaving many Easter Eggs that my travelling partner immediately picked up. Who is this mysterious person and why are they so elusive?

Yes, the Paul that you speak of is a strange one indeed, who has been known to float around Runescape like some sort of all-powerful jellyfish, squeezing out offerings at certain special times of year.

Until next time my friends.

Obviously they are using a cheat, macro, or autominer which is clearly against the rules of Runescape. It is not fair on all of us fair players who gain our XP fairly! I know you have come up with that monster thing to stop some cheaters but it does not stop the mining and fishing ones!

<a href="/images/miner-animation.gif"><img class="rsc-image" src="/images/miner-animation.gif" align="right" /></a>
Yes, everyone is tired of the cheaters that you speak of. As such we are changing mining and fishing shortly so that they no longer consist of hours of tedious repetative clicking. They will be made more fun, and harder to cheat. The rocks will be much easier to mine, but you will need to rest or eat food occasionally whilst mining.

The upshot of this is that honest miners should be able to mine ore slightly quicker, whilst the cheats will just have to go somewhere else.

Yes, there has been a lot of interest in the fancy dress shop and its red party hat. And if the shop-keeper was actually able to get some in stock, I''m sure there would even more.

Archery and magic are the two major skills where a citizen can join into an established conflict, and perhaps even come away as the ultimate victor.

As a god of peace, I am a firm believer in the value of constructive dialogue. So please allow me to defer to a more contrary voice on the matter.

> My suggestion concerns archers. It is great that we can use bows and arrows as alternatives to getting our hands dirty in melee combat, but I really cannot stand it when I am fighting with my trusty dragon axe and an archer comes along and steals some of my experience, shooting the monster I am fighting. It is rude, and the same goes for somebody starting a fight with a monster that is already getting ranged. Could you perhaps make it so that a monster cannot be attacked at all once it has already been attacked?

*Mightyankh*

Hmm, seems like we''ve got a bit of an impasse here. Looks like you''re just going to have to learn how to get along. A prayer to prevent others from interfering with your combat is however planned at some point in the distant future.

*Adikt*

Well there are lots of theories about black holes, with some professors claiming that they represent the origins of evolution itself. But when you''re a god you don''t like to harp on about the whole evolution thing too much.

In scientific terms, black holes represented the world''s first sin bin, banishing miscreants for all eternity.Or at least for some of it. The only problem was, the black hole developed such a reputation that warriors were going out of their way to be plunged into its eternal void. Those who had sworn blind to be upright individuals now just swore blindly. Anything to get thrown into the black hole.

Only later did was it discovered that this was the work of Zamorock, cleverly designed in order to glamorise evil deeds. From then on the council just banned people instead, and with no more matter to envelop, the black hole turned in on itself and imploded.

> Dear Saradomin,
> The world of Runescape is indeed evolving fast. There is more to be found now than there was a year ago. And with it, prices of newly introduced items are immensly high. All these coins are piling up in bank accounts and trades are getting really long. Would it not be a joy to have value-paper? This would make trades a lot shorter. A proposal: 1 piece of value-paper is worth 10,000 gold coins.

*Your humble follower, Highveener*

> If anyone should want to pay to play Runescape, I believe that they should only have to pay $5 in their own currency. Such as in Australia, we have to pay $10 Australian, which is about the same as $5 American. Why should we have to pay more to have the same rights as everyone in America? It''s the same as making someone do something to get into a club when no-one else did. Why? Please make it fair on us soon, I hope you can even this out.

Perhaps I spoke to soon before. Even the greatest system of money is only as wise as the people who use it. But as far as fairness is concerned, I can tell you that $10 Australian is about the same as $5 American.

*Canvasch*

Swearing on their mothers'' graves and then attacking you? I wonder how meticulous you are about your choice of friends. But you''re right in saying that the wilderness is essentially a Zamorakian affair. It seems that even the most good-natured of players gets the urge to decapitate his fellow man occasionally. And so the wilderness enables them to do this. Of course swearing is still not allowed in the wilderness, and if someone is verbally offensive to you, please use the ''report abuse'' button.

More than one kebab at a time? That would be just decadent. Runescape is supposed to be a land of finely-tuned warrior poets, not grease encrusted slobs!

Besides, the kebab seller has to prepare them individually, so that you can always be sure of its freshness. Especially since goblin meat doesn''t tend to keep too long.

You should not feel ashamed Mr. Lamer. Well, maybe just a little bit. But your name is your identity and your birthright, so wear it with pride. The important thing is what your name represents.

Null is a mystical guardian who protects you when you first enter new areas. He is a passive and benevolent force, and as such his combat level never rises above 1. He appears and disappears in order to attend to the needs of all those who may require his protection.

A good question. The mithril rocks respawn was increased,which meant that they needed to be a long way from a bed to stop them becoming too powerful.

However, under the new hard rock / soft rock system you can expect to see a couple of soft mithril rocks making a return to the miners guild soon.

How wrong you were! But don''t worry, lots of people are ignorant without being heretics. Although strangely enough the mage Andrew doesn''t seem to believe me either. In fact he agrees with you, and says "When you first meet someone in the game they will be called ''null'' until the server sends the name and appearance of that player to your machine. Don''t worry, it doesn''t actually affect the gameplay."

Hail, all ye followers of darkness! Cower in terror, all seekers of light. Everyone else can just listen. That self-righteous brother of mine has been hogging the stage for far too long, especially when Runescape players know who holds the real power around here- me!

So I''ve stolen Saradomin''s mailbag and thrown all his letters on the floor. I had to pick them up again in order to read them, but I think I made my point.
Some of them were quite good actually- even if most represented the sort of pathetic whining that I would expect from followers of Saradomin.

For example:

> Dear Saradomin
>
> Us Runescape Veterans are so under-rated. I''ve been called a noob, yet I''ve been here since the beginning, and yet when someone asks, when Runescape came out, everyone insists 2000. Yet as soon as I say ''98, it''s a big laugh. Though in your newsletter, you stated, "Five Ages after creating the world of Runescape, the great god Saradomin now regularly communicates with the inhabitants of this fast evolving planet." Does that prove that Runescape came out in ''98?

*Wizarding2*

Clearly not. And if you were truly a "veteran", you would know when Runescape was created. Your friends are right to laugh at you.

But at the same time, you were obviously trying to intimidate others with your pretence of superior knowledge, and for this you deserve some credit.

In other letters and prayers, Toxy55 asks "where skeletons come from". My advice would be to head down to the wilderness and find out. As Guthix would say, the answers are inside of you.

Ah, how I love the wildy. That place where death and deceit go hand in hand.

For some, this is a problem. Jacob9ruler complains that "it is hard to find someone who doesn''t deceive another person in the wilderness, to gain something like an item".

<p class="rsc-centre-text"><a href="/images/knight-under-attack.jpg"><img class="rsc-image" src="/images/knight-under-attack.jpg" /></a></p>

> "I found that around 35% of the people I ''Team'' with actually end up killing me."

This is what I like to hear! So be warned all naive and foolish types: conducting surveys on the trustworthiness of your friends can leave you vulnerable to attack. But the final word must go to Kenny22, on the subject of Christmas hats.

> "I, personally, woke up at 4am eastern standard time to get the hats." (applause).

He then complains about the fact that his friend logged on at 12pm and was also able to find hats.

As god of chaos and evil, I naturally assumed that I was the expert at bringing misery into people''s lives. But you, Kenny22, show a level of stinginess that surpasses all other Kennys, a meanness of heart that I thought was unattainable in mere mortals.

Feeling suitably inspired, I must now go and bring some more chaos and destruction to the universe. To all those who have been waiting patiently for me, our moment is nigh!

For god''s sake- all three of us- that''s the whole point about the wilderness- it''s dangerous! And as much as I despise my brother Saradomin, even he recognises that the wilderness is a place of chaos, death and destruction.

We''re not trying to run a theme park here...

Perhaps you could make this ability a prayer that uses up points or a skill of agility which uses up fatigue.

Hmmm, it''s funny you should mention that. I happen to know that the Council of Runescape is toying with the idea of some sort of speed burst or running ability, which would probably induce fatigue. So well done on anticipating this change: Great minds think alike. Fools seldom differ.

Well I''m certainly not ignorant of anything. A tad lazy maybe... but since this is a newsletter I can hardly "prove" that this is in fact untrue. I can only "tell you" that it is a blatant lie, presumably designed to lure foolish adventurers towards the mythical bounty, like a sailor to a siren. So full marks to whoever came up with it.

Just because Runescape is based in Europe doesn''t mean that you can''t have a American Holiday. I can''t believe that 3 omniescient gods forgot Valentines. The worst part is that I didn''t know I was wondering for 3 hours before I found out from 12am to 3am. Gods just aren''t what they used to be.

<div style="clear:both"></div>

I didn''t forget Valentines and nor did Saradomin. We both gave and received Valentines cards, in fact. The one I got was from Saradomin''s (now ex) girlfriend- now that''s what I call all-powerful!
So all you''ve really told me is that no-one wanted to give YOU anything. In which case I suggest you take a good hard look in the mirror and start asking yourself some difficult questions.

Yes, when the new game engine update happens it will include weapons with their own special moves. And they''ll be a lot more exciting than your piffling little stabs and slashes.

> I recently read that multiple player combat would be available in the 3-d version. Most people would think this is a good idea, but i know from experience it is not. Before I played runescape, I played another MMORPG which had this same system and it was great and all, until the game got popular (about as popular as runescape) and the game was filled with dishonest lower lvl. These people would constantly deal just a death blow on the monster your fighting to get the drop...
> Unless you make it so there is an option to turn off multiple player combat for the monsters that particular person is fighting, I urge you not to apply this update, well, stop Andrew from making the update, you have evil powers right?

The details of multi-player fighting are still being decided, but there will be an option to disable multi-player fighting for those who want to fight alone. I do know that the revamped game system will allow us to have a combat system that is very fair and accurate in it''s designation of hits and scores. I did try to argue with Andrew against all this fairness, but he wasn''t having it.

The council once put together a team of highly qualified cartographers, and issued them with large amounts of gold and lobsters as provisions, then sent them into the wilderness to map it.

Needless to say, my followers there ate very well that night.

The council didn''t really want to send any more mappers after that for some strange reason.

I can bet a lot of people already know about this, but once you finally get to wine it does nothing at all. I bought one pitcher from the store, you cannot drink it, and I don''t know what you can use it on. Is there a purpose to your Wine of Zamorak? Or did you just setup this whole thing as a "gauntlet" to kill people who think they are getting a prize that is actully nothing?

*NASCARFAN03*

As much as I like the idea of meaningless death, Wine of Zamorak does indeed have a purpose. You just obviously haven''t discovered it yet...

<p class="rsc-centre-text"><em>Sincerely Jackaroo1</em></p>

I scammed the other gods out of their full rune and got reported for abuse.

Kidding.

I''m not banned from RuneScape... The other gods and myself simply have an agreement not to interfere directly with the matters of mere mortals anymore. Who has the power to ban Zamorak The Mighty? Or the courage? No-one, thats who. Thats not to say the other gods wouldn''t love to ban me, because they would. Oh, they really would. But they can''t.

<a href="/images/leftover-bunnies.jpg"><img class="rsc-image" src="/images/leftover-bunnies.jpg" align="right" /></a>

Oh they''re real. I think you answered your own question there...
The reason there aren''t any bunnies left in RuneScape is so that there were enough bunny ears to go around. As it would be cruel to let loose a bunch of mutilated animals upon the world (although I personally would have found that very funny) The council decided to eat what was left.

The last I heard they had enough Rabbit jerky to last them for 40 years.
80 as part of a balanced nutritional diet.

I would use the report abuse button, but it is not really covered by any of the catorgaries, and unless teh tech support people were looking very hard, they might not spot the scam.

According to the Council, there were not adequate funds to provide a waste disposal service for the inhabitants of RuneScape to dispose of their rubbish, with the result being that thoughtless inhabitants simply throw their rubbish into nearby rivers and streams, or off cliffs, with zero regard for the impact on the environment.

Excellent. Littering might not be up there with looting and backstabbing, but its still a cause I whole heartedly approve of.

Please respond and try to take this rule away.

<p class="rsc-centre-text"><em>Dakingruler</em></p>

Just one example of the hundreds who write to me complaining about non tradable and limited bunny ears. They all start their email the same way
"What if someone wasn''t around to get them?"
and they all end the same way
"I really wanted to make some easy money".

Foolish mortals... the council once thought it would be a nice present to players who were playing on holidays to give them a unique item.

This has now become an expectation that there will always be rare drops on holidays, and that these will be easy ways to make money.

They''re not. They''re a present. If you weren''t playing, you missed out.
I am extremely pleased that the foolish Andrew in an effort to give people gifts and make them happy instead manages to annoy people.

It reaffirms my belief in the underlying selfishness of you all.

I was sent this picture recently of my foolish brother saradomin:

<p class="rsc-centre-text"><a href="/images/fool-saradomin.jpg"><img class="rsc-image" src="/images/fool-saradomin.jpg" /></a></p>

> Whaddya think?

I commend the author on their skill in capturing the ugliness and self satisfied, smug, stupidity of Saradomin so well.
Excellent work.

I just have time to answer a few quick questions before I get back to spreading corruption and death:

Seamus Aran asks: *"What football team/s do you support?"*
Saradomin likes the Lumbridge Eagles, I prefer the Ardougne Chimeras. Guthix says hes not really into competitive sports much. Guthix is kind of boring that way.

Leszek 14 asks: *"well where are the trolls????"*
I believe most of them left RuneScape to hang out on Internet message boards a while back, although as they are a race I particularly like I will be doing my best to bring some back to RuneScape.

Evil Doer asked *"what sword you have?"*
To which I reply: weapons are for the weak. A True Zamorackian would rejoice in nothing less than the slaughter of his enemies with his bare fists.

Nyar DCE questions me *"How many people work at Jagex?""*
About half, on a good day.

Just pures wrote to say *"In runescape there should be some freshing drinks like sprite coca-cola and fanta"*
Which amused me no end, as the number of pathetic complaints about the adverts that surround the free players game would undoubtedly increase if runescape started to have brand name products within the game.
An excellently evil idea, that I fear the council would never approve of.

If however any well known drinks manufacturers would like to contact me personally with large offers of gold, I will happily have Iban open a shop in their name...

MrMario asked *"What happened to Saradomin?"*
To which I respond, you should not ask too much or I will have no course left to me but to demonstrate what I did to the silly old fool personally upon you.
It would probably be fatal to a mortal. Its certainly very painful to a god...

Far far too many people ask: *"Whats the deal with those Red Cards?"*
to which I reply, they are given away free at the start of the Tourist Trap quest.

No, they are not worth thousands of gold... Perhaps it is the word ''free'' in their description that puzzled the weaker minded players amongst you?

Until next time loyal followers,

My lesser brothers oft do boast of feats against each other, yet the truth is that neither has the power they claim, and Zamoraks theft of the letters was simply a theft.

Saradomin exists still, and holds as much sway with his followers as ever.
It is also a matter of record that neither canst utilise my powers through herblaw, for neither are open to admit that their powers are inferior to mine own - such is the way of those blinded by overriding principle.

The rarity of such gifts is not in their number, but in their limited span of existence without owners. I canst indeed confirm that players who were working through the guides of wisdom of tutorial island were not held to be any different to those beings elsewhere on the planet, and were indeed graced with the bounties of bunny ears. It is the nature of balance that gifts to all, are available to all, regardless of stature.

It saddens me that thou feel such contempt for your fellow players; for it is truly their benificence that allows your own existence; is it not also obvious to all that those who have access to greater numbers of enemies, lands and items, hath need of storage far more than those who have but limited access?

To see the world through only one perspective is to deny thyself the truths of a perspective that shares both.
Many believe in my way, although they mayst not know it, and part of this belief is to not acknowledge either perspective as ''better'' for they are equal yet different.
Guthix is the creator, and Guthix is the only true god of RuneScape, believe not the lies of my lesser brothers, they have motives of their own that canst not be trusted.

Scamming is clearly evil, and I have noticed with every new members update there are new items that seem to have no other purpose than to scam non-members with.

*~ odium imbues ~*

Scammers and beggars are known to be the worst creatures of this land, more hated than Dragons and worth less reward when killed. I do not believe in condeming those who choose their own paths of right and wrong in this land, but they please no god but their own selfish ends, and not even the evil Zamorak will mourn their passing. Scammers deserve to lose their accounts, which is easily achieved through the report abuse button when thou see them scamming someone, and beggars deserve to be taken to the wilderness and shown the error of their ways.

> Dear Almighty Saradomin,
> I have come to you in hopes of gaining knowlegde. I have heard in some of the letters that you had answered about the biohazard quest. Now I am not a member but I was wondering nonetheless, if you could be so generous as to give me a little background information on this quest.

*Almanac1, a follower of the mighty Saradomin,*

An evil man with noble blood hath opened the door to an evil he cannot comprehend in the ancient city of Ardougne.
A result of his actions was a great plague upon the people whose cause couldst not be so easily explained, yet rumours tried to do just that.
I canst not give greater detail about the events of the Quest, for to do so would be to change the actions that must happen naturally, yet the events that occurred doth truly sadden my heart.

I am beyond good or evil, I am simply Guthix.
Of future events, I see most clear, yet things that must be, must be.
I couldst change them if I so desired, but I do not, for all things must happen as they run their course.
It is not beyond my power however to leave some small hint of when they may occur, and I can say that there will be a change most noticable upon the lands and people sometime between the equinoxes.

> Dear most dispicable Zamorak,
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where can I find out about the next updates that are coming to Runescape? I just wish to know what is going to happen.

*TiggerD78*

As things change, news will appear.
As thou mayst have already noticed there are a number of small screenshots of this changed world available now, and the news and updates will give you reliable news of these updates first. Check it regularly and thou willst always know what is happening most precisely; and believe not the liars and braggards who claim to know things that others do not, for they lie for their own ends.

> Fatigue has been annoying as in life even if you are exausted one second you can rest for a few minutes or get a drink of water and you can last for a while longer. We need a system where we can rest for a bit and then get back to work. this should be that if you go out and do hard work you can take a little rest and get up with out going back to a bed but where we caan;t rest back down to 0 fatigue because we can only last for a while when we do this, we need to be able to rest where we are mining then after a while that won''t work anymore and we will have to go to bed and get our deserved rest.

*From, supersmash worshiper of guthix.*

Fatigue ist a strange and ever changing condition that has puzzled the people of my world for a long time; as thou mayest have already noticed, such a change as thou hath suggested has already occurred, and the oft requested sleeping bag hath finally been made available to all.
As with all things however, there has been a price.
This is the nature of balance.

> Greetings so called ruler of darkness.

Provide me with this power oh false god of darkness, so thou mayest be considered true in thine alignment. Craving true power,
> JowyKnight

Necromancy is an abomination to me, for it blurs the line between death and life, both of which are vital states that are required for the balance of this world to be maintained. Only the most evil beings follow such dark arts, and those who do so challenge not just my authority but those of mine lesser brothers too. I wouldst say that 3 gods doing their utmost to prevent any more necromancers fromst entering my lands means it ist unlikely for any mere mortal to achieve such dark arts, unless by some reason they are needed for balance in the future.

> Hey Zamorak,
> What has happened to tha Elves? If there are Dwarves and Barbarians, why not Elves? Are they in hiding, or can u make them appear? They should be a part of Runescape as well. Like me, they are very honorable, and as much as I don''t worship you, I think Elves need to live.

*Knifedge3*

The elves are a noble race, suffering great hardships, and have tried to stay hidden from man for their own reasons. I have seen their plight, and sometimes wish I couldst assist them against their travails, but I am Guthix, and I cannot alter the balance of the world.
Players will some day be able to meet the Elves, yet they are not ready to do just yet.
When they do I hope thou canst help them, for i have seen the future of their race, and it is dark and full of difficulties.

*~Eddeland~*

The Council are those who run the day to day affairs of the world of RuneScape.
As they art the ones who set the taxes for all of the businesses they prefer to remain anonymous, for there are many merchants who resent having to give them money on every sale made, and many watchmen who resent their low wages for the difficult job they must do.
Many watchmen also suspect that there be some fraudulent deductions made on their pay, for they pay a large sum as a pension, yet have a very low life expectancy, especially in large cities.

---

> Zamorak,
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw the new opinion poll feature on the Runescape website, and I think it''s a great idea. There''s one flaw, though. Since you continuously update the poll and display the results, many people will be influenced to vote for whatever is the most popular at the time. It''s just like the 2000 Presidential Election in the United States, where people in California were voting differently because television networks announced results from the East Coast. If you show the results to people before they even vote, the poll will be meaningless.

*Bigbigbigbig*

I see no flaws with the Poll, for it hath brought me from my silence to spread truth and honesty about the world against the lies of Saradomin and Zamorak that prevailed before. Democracy is truly a beautiful thing, for it allows balance of beliefs and opinions.
Guthix is clearly more revered than had hitherto been suspected, a fact that annoyed the Council who wished to keep matters secret, that I will freely tell.

It means that you keep yours to yours actually. by the way no offense to the god but I am actually glad you took the letters away from SaroDIM .
> They were getting boring.

Both Saradomin and Zamorak were compelled by my power to cease their direct interference on my world of RuneScape as when last they walked my realm it wast nearly destroyed by their squabbling.
There wast no specific incident that hath caused this, I had simply had my fill of their wars destroying my beautiful planet and prevented them from interfering anymore.
They are however both mightily powerful, and I cannot fully prevent their indirect actions upon the world.
As for those who say I do nothing - who makes the rivers flow? Who makes the trees and plants continue their cycles of death and rebirth? Who keeps the endless circles of Nature and Balance from breaking and bringing destruction to the lands? It is Guthix who keeps the land inhabitable, those who follow me understand these truths.

I guess its a habit of mine of examining everything i see. Can you give me any advice to stop my embarrasing habit?

I thinkst not that thine ''habit'' be embarrassing; truly it is the nature of life to be curious of its surroundings, and seek to discover more of the mysteries of the lands they walk. I commend thee on thy intellect to examine the objects which so many others might simply ignore on their way, for everything has a purpose on the world, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant.

I thinkst that thou doth judge the free players too harshly; I am an essence of balance, and the free players help balance my world.

Pures are an abomination to me, for they shun the thing that they should seek to find: Balance in all things.
Thou make thy pleas to the wrong god, for all true followers of Guthix hate these so called ''pures'' for their ignorance of the power that can be found in balance.
Thou deservest to walk until thy very feet are raw with effort, for ignoring my teachings and trying to become something that thou shouldst not. When my plans are unfurled, ''pures'' will be the very first to suffer of all the creatures of this world.

Zamorak and Saradomin are both limited beings by their all encompassing adherence to one philosophy: it prevents them from ever seeing the truths that lie behind the universe, and they will always fail in their actions because of this. As you rightly surmise, if either of them were flexible enough to take a part of the others beliefs and make them their own, then they and their followers could quickly and decisively make an end of their warring for once and for all.

This is why I Guthix am mightiest of all gods, for only I fully comprehend the nature and mysteries of the universe, and the power that lies in achieving a finely tuned balance.
Thou makest an interesting challenge towards Zamorak with thine words, but I fear to disillusion you: an ant with the greatest blade and armour in the world, is still no match for a bear armed with nothing...

> Greetings o'' evil one, I have a question I would like you to answer. Since your a god, what do you do for fun? Do you send Sarodomin a bunch of dumb annoying Emails, or go down to Port Sarmin and ride your private yacht around? WHAT DO YOU DO???

I consider the balances of the universe and attempt to refine these balances upon mine world which thou inhabit.
I believe Zamorak takes mischievous pride in high level players suffering deaths to lower levels and in the ignoble defeats of mighty warriors to relatively puny monsters.
Saradomin hath a great pride upon himself, and his time is mostly spent with listening to the songs of his glories from the religious and the offerings of bones made to him by those seeking to gain his favour through prayers.

---

*Greetings : Honke_ponke*

I hold a different belief than mine brothers, for I believe fighting should only be for a specific cause, not as a general attempt to gain favour with a god. I specifically do not seek followers, they must come to me of their own free will.
If you had asked mine brothers however, they would both tell you that they are the mightier, and that their way is the only true way, and that thou must smite thine enemies while singing praises to them, the cause being second to the glorification of themselves.

---

> Lord Zamorak,
>
> Hail the almighty god of choas and destuction, Zamorak!! I was wondering what is one the runescape coin??

There are numerous different currencies throughout mine realms, with each of the major fiefs holding a different currency, yet all are of similar size, weight, and all made of purest gold, so they are accepted everywhere regardless of the patterning which merely shows from whence they came.
The standard coinage is to have either the royal coat of arms or a profile of the ruler of the land on one side of the coin, and a symbolic design on the other. Varrock for example hath a shield motif on one side, and the Varrockian Crest on the other, the shield being testament to a great hero who once did dwell there.

Zamorak will often evade mention of this, for he fears people discovering too much of himself, yet I canst tell you that it is one of the ingredients of a mighty elixir which shouldst be of interest to all students of the apothecral arts.

There hath been a mighty change to the way that fatigue affects mine people, and the way that sleeping canst be used to reduce it.
As with all things it is a question of balance: you willst probably be gladdened that sleeping is now even easier with the invention of ''sleeping bags'' (which seemst to me some form of transportable bed) yet will be dismayed that there is now more fatigue requiring more sleep.
With everything there is a cost; this is the nature of balance.

---

> Both you and your weak, feeble minded btohter Saradomin have symbols that your followers can wear to make their dedication known. Does Guthix have any symbols of his own?

I have no symbols, for I have no ''real'' followers. To pick one option over another is to disrupt the balance of all, and that is what I represent. Thou mayest say that my symbol is to not have a symbol...

---

> Hated zamorak
> i thougt the nature was in a evelotiun but why has the jungle spiders on the old gnome island devolved from lvl 61 to 47?

*//JVXS a dear follower of saradomin*

All things must change to preserve the balance; if certain creatures on my land seemst out of place through their strength, then it ist my duty to either remove them, or to diminish their powers to a more lowly level.
It doth not happen often, but is sometimes essential, so that a greater balance can be achieved.

---

> Your godliness,
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried contacting your brother guthix but, my message would not reach thrugh it said there was no such address for him. What email address should i send my letters to?

*Owentheyo*

Many gods do not understand this thing called ''email'' but i have been informed by certain members of the council that they will allow those wishing to seek my favour and knowledge to contact me directly; but as greatest of the Gods I see all messages addressed to both Zamorak and Saradomin, and can intercept them when necessary.

*Always in your command Ganther*

My followers do not wish to expand to form a third ''faction'' upon this already troubled world; no, it is the aim of all of my followers to achieve the perfect balance that once existed on this land before the interference of Zamorak and Sardomin caused such strife and war upon the world. Mine followers will pick sides as necessary, but will always follow the true path of balance; performing acts of goodness and mercy when needed, yet being merciless and cruel to their enemies when time dictates.
Mine followers would never declare themselves openly to be my followers through such empty and posturing gestures as ''symbols'' for they know in their hearts they have my support if they follow me truly.

<p class="rsc-centre-text"><em>Whatsmyname</em></p>

An advocate wouldst be one way of describing the necessary role which mine lesser brother Zamorak fills; another would be a personification. He is a god of Chaos, for he is a god, and yet he is also Chaos itself.

It is sad that some weak-minded individuals cannot tell the difference between my realm of RuneScape and the world from which most players originiate, seeking to combine the two and sell in one that which cannot be bought in the other.
It is against RuneScapes rules, and more than this, it personally offends mine own sense of balance. I beg of any such auctions found by players to be reported to the councils hard working customer support team so that they might be closed and their accounts removed.

It is not in my nature to reward those who follow me, for those who follow me do so for their desire to see balance, and balance is its own reward for those chosen few.
Material wealth means nothing, unless it is used for a specific purpose too - those who squander their monies on useless trinkets such as ''party hats'' simply to display their meaningless wealth know nothing of the true ways of Guthix.

Greetings loyal followers! Many of you may have wondered why I allowed the despicable Zamorak access to your prayers to me, and to this all I can say is:
sorry about that.
The fiend stole the bag which I keep my messages in, and replaced it with a bag full of little pieces of paper saying "Get your axes from Bob''s axes".
What the meaning of this is, I do not know, but apparently while I was busy wondering why nobody writes to me anymore, Zamorak has been having fun abusing my loyal believers.
I don''t even want to start on what Guthix has been saying... partly because I don''t understand most of it. Nature gods really aren''t that good at conversational skills.

I would also like to clear up beyond a shadow of a doubt, that I have not been "hiding because I was wrong about sleeping bags" as Zamorak has been telling people.
I wasn''t wrong. I''m never wrong. I was just not totally right.
Anyway, now I am back in receipt of my faithfuls'' pleas, let''s answer some queries!

The truth is that the council once tried to put a sales tax on all those who purchase water from taverns, but it was very unpopular with those who felt that things that can be found just lying around (water, meat, bones, etc) should not have to be paid for.

The council resolved this by simply outlawing the sale of water throughout the lands.
On a different note, I would suggest to anyone visiting RuneScape for a holiday this year NOT try drinking the water - as many a fisherman will attest, you find all sorts in it... and a nice cold ale is far less hazardous to your health.

> dear saradomin,

> Is there cheats or auto miner''s on runescape i have seen many charathers trying to scam newbies like this: ''''pay me 50k and i tell you how you can use autominer'''' so can you tell is there real auto miners or cheats in this game and why free version has only one bank list??? and can you put 3 bank lists in free version???

Apart from the obvious fact that ''cheating'' in ANYTHING be it merely a game, or your life, is wrong and will ultimately bring you nothing satisfactory, there ARE no cheats in RuneScape.
Oh, people may tell you different... but those people are trying to ''cheat'' by stealing your account. Which I don''t think is what you want.
Your life will be far more complete if you work hard for your rewards, because the satisfaction gained is far greater when you have achieved something by your own dedicated effort... and I would suggest you use the ''report abuse'' button to catch any of these liars before they harm a player not as slow to trust as yourself.

> O knowledgable and great Guthix , I humbly ask on behalf of all wood cutters please can we have a similar system to the miners , we had different varieties of hatchets a long time before them but it seems that we have been overlooked in this matter. Whilst we thank you for saving our mice and fingers from strain while mining ,please please please can do the same for wood cutting.

I apologise to you noble woodcutter for the interception of your message intended for Guthix, but I was deeply impressed with the realistic sculpture which image you have included; it is in my mind a work of art, and you should tell your daughter that Saradomin is a great appreciater of fine art. Verily, the sculpture almost appears alive, so true a likeness is it to the people of RuneScape.
On the subject of woodcutting, I do not believe that such a system is needed at the present time, but I have no fear that if Guthix decides such a thing will be necessary to prevent the incompetent hacking at trees without a point, then he will probably introduce it.
Probably with some longwinded explanation about ''balance'' too.

> O great one Saradomin,
> I must first say that I thouroughly enjoy wandering daily around your beautiful world (Please Note: I am not a brown noser) meeting people and improving my skills. However, there is one small thing that bothers me. I am a relatively new ''citizen'' to your world and I am of a mere level 14, and when I am performing quests, I often get attacked by higher level beasts, for example giant rats or scorpions. This often results in my death, and I hav to start the quest all over again. So I thought that it would be a good idea that two citizens may attack a hostile creature at once. At the moment, one player may attack while another casts spells, but when their rune supply is low, they are more or less useless.

Although I believe combat is wrong in all forms, and that the simplest solution would be to not get into combat at all, I also know full well that the cursed Zamorak enjoys tormenting honest workers on their travels with all manner of creatures.
I am glad to say that when the 3D update occurs you will be able to be assisted by your friends in hand to hand combat, and not just assisted by rangers and mages.
Hopefully this will allow my Holy Warriors to restore peace to my lands at all costs, and finally drive the evil zamorak away for good.

It saddens me to see life go to waste following the lies of Zamorak, yet it amuses me to see that even his most dedicated followers don''t know how to spell his name correctly.
The reason my Holy Symbol is available everywhere, is because it''s better.
I am the greatest, so more people want to show their alleigance to me, so more shops sell it because it is more popular and they will make more money from it.
Yet more proof that I am the greatest god, because I have the most followers.
It''s not too late to change alleigance and glorify me with my stylish Holy Symbol you know, and you''re already on the right step by getting my name right!

> dear almighty god saradomin, you have blessed us with an excellent way of holding our unstackable objects, by means of the certificate... although there is one item that i beleive deserves a certificate of its own. the bone! i have been scammed once before by someone asking to trade a runite two hander (i would only have used it as self defence my lord!) for a certain amount of big bones. i could not trade all of the bones at one time, so he said half way through he would trade the sword. obviously he kept the bones, and weapon for himself. this is why i request bone certificates..so others arent scammed the way i was.. certs for dragon bones, bat bones, and all of the other many types of bones with wich to praise you with! i also hope in the future for more techniques that prayer allows you to do. thank you for your time almighty saradomin! until we talk again.. your loyal follower -zak1

One of the most ghastly and morbid suggestions I have ever heard... to take the remains of the deceased and instead of giving them peace in their death and glorifying me through their burial, instead defiling them, and using them as some form of currency.
Apart from the health risks associated with storing large quantities of unclean dead objects, I find this idea morally repugnant, and the idea that you would ask for this in order to praise me shocks me to the core.
I suggest you find new ways to revel in my glory, for I will have no part of this macabre scheme.

I personally know not, but surmise it was some rich yet morally corrupt adventurer seeking to atone for his sins against me by leaving an anonymous donation with my monks.
Or possibly some unlucky zamorakian fell foul of my followers divine strength by getting too cocky, and ended up the victim to a ''harmless'' monks anger.

I will take this question from Guthix, for he knows very little of the ways of men. And when it comes to money, almost nothing (he just can''t understand the concept of ownership, I''m afraid), and it is my duty to help where I can.
1. When you become a member you may specify which character you would like the membership to apply to: if you wish to bring your current character to enjoy the new lands and adventures which membership offers, you can.
This is the choice that many people take, and you bring with him all items and wealth so far accumulated.
Also of course, although this option is not as favoured, you can create a new character and begin your explorations of the world anew in the members area.

2. If you feel that you have seen all that membership has to offer you (although I suspect this will not be a problem for a while, given that the members lands are continuously being explored and mapped, with new adventures and areas to explore being discovered) you can indeed return your character to the smaller free lands with skills and stats intact.
However, if you have items stored in your larger ''members bank'' you will not be able to deposit any items until your bank is as small as the ''free bank''.
This is unfortunate, but it is the councils policies regarding interest rates and inflation that compel the First National RuneScape Bank to implement this policy.

You will also of course be unable to use any of the ''members only'' abilities that you may have acquired, such as agility or herblaw, in the ''free lands''.

Yes. Well.
Why don''t I just set everyones level to 99 and give everyone full rune while I''m at it? Then theres no need to even play the game anymore.
It takes a rare suggestion to make Holy Saradomin resort to sarcasm, you should feel honoured.

*Lorec21*

My best advice would be to read [THIS GUIDE ON PREVENTING HACKING](#TODO) and follow its instructions well. I would also recommend not using words written as in dictionaries as your password, but instead replacing a few letters with numbers.

Combining both of these pieces of advice should ensure your character lives securely.

I have spoken at some length now, so I should be getting back to my daily duties, but I have just enough time to answer a few quick queries I have received:

Princemarcus asks:*"I wonder if we would be able to contact this lesser known god, zaros"*
To which I say: Speak not of Zaros. Mention not his name, nor discuss him. Some things are better left unknown.

*"i think monk bones should give more prayer xp that normal bones."* - Apocalypse1
I think killing my followers would make me favour you less, not more.

*"Hi, I think there sould at least be 1 new quest for runscape."*
So do I. Oh look, one just got released. How lucky.

*"Hi I was wondering when the next Halloween will be in rune scape and is there any more times that u give out free items.?"*
Halloween is usually at the end of October, and along with Easter and Christmas sometimes gives players presents from the Council.
You shouldn''t necessarily expect to receive any gifts however. the council are frequently absent minded.

Redk99 says: *"I need a map of some kind that shows me where I am in the world."*
Perhaps [THIS PAGE](#TODO) will be of interest to you?

iamblh3 complains *"I hate the new fatigue.I`m cursed by it from just walking and picking things up."*
I think you should see an apothecary as soon as possible for you apparently have a medical condition that no-one else has.
And stay away from me, I''m a busy deity and can''t afford to be slowed down with mystery illnesses.

*"I have been trying to find a place where I can get your holy symbol blessed"* - GoatGod05
I suggest you go and speak to Brother Jered at the monastery, he is always keen on assisting those wishing to spread my glories across the land by wearing my symbol.

lightsilver asks *"Is it true that runescape is updating to 3D?"*
Yes, yes it is. I suggest you check the News & Updates section of the site a little more regularly...

*"we where hoping that you would make an update that allows crafters to make gold coins from gold bars"* - bite9611111
Forgery is a serious crime, and only those coins minted by the respective Fief are legal tender. If forgery were not a serious crime here on RuneScape the economy would surely have been destroyed by a certain spell known as high level alchemy by now...

Hello once again loyal Zamorakians!
I know how dull these letters pages have been getting recently, what with Guthix''s bizarre rantings and whinings, and Saradomins self-righteous complaining, but once more I return, to spread a little cheer, and a lot of fear, to those who seek my advice, and some who don''t!

> dear really evil dude,
> i was just wondering why burying bones increases your prayer level.

<p class="rsc-centre-text"><em>yours unsinserely,</em><br /><em>cool dude100</em></p>

Saradomin deals with prayers, so when you give dead creatures / people an honourable burial in his name it makes him pay closer attention to you, and help you out in little ways that Guthix won''t notice.

Personally, I think when you kill something you should just take its bones and trade them for something decent. Like a sword, which will help you get MORE bones.

Or just, you know, drop them in mud and pour bad wine over them or something. Just to annoy Saradomin.

Saradomin is very amusing when annoyed. It heartens me no end.

Pffffft... ''Scammers''.....
I don''t like ''scammers'' because they''re whiney little liars who are too sissy to go out and kill stuff to get rich like a \*TRUE\* Zamorakian would do.
Lure them out to a nice little spot in the wilderness and show them the business end of your favorite weaponry (A lot of fun) or (as useless as the Council are) the report abuse button is a good option too.

People like that give evil a bad name, you know!

Writing stuff sounds a bit too sissy to me... are you sure you''re not a Saradominist trying to trick me?
Then again, putting the fear of Zamorak into little children does sound quite tempting...

I guess I can lay off torturing Reldo with little ''accidents'' for a bit if you have any PARTICULARLY spooky stuff to honour me with. I believe you can however send your stories to Reldo.

But I''m not sure when he will next update his library. He tends to have a lot of ''unfortunate accidents'' happen to him, particularly when I''m rather bored...

It''s the magical mauve money-dropping monster!

Yeah, sissy cowards who run away from a fight REALLY annoy me...

They''re worth whatever people are foolish enough to pay for them.

Put not thy faith in rumour, for often they shall deceive intentionally, and the rare occasion that they doth find the grain of truth ist not worthy of counting. I can tell thee true however, the first three rumours that thou mention are falsehoods, and the fourth, if I understand thy meaning correctly, ist already in effect upon this plane...

> Why does Guthix exist? It has been this one''s experience that any and every god which doesn''t have followers will cease to be, yet the gods of Runescape seem to exist independently of human belief. Is there something about Runescape itself that allows this, or is it the gods themselves?

<p class="rsc-centre-text"><em>Vkand</em></p>

Thy assumption is mostly correct noble philosopher; most gods mayst not stay long on a plane where their existence ist not demanded by followers.
Just speaking the name of a god canst give them power enough to enter this plane, and with followers then they mayst remain.

I am not most gods however; mine power is drawn from the land, from the seas, from the plants and trees, from the very essences of life that dwell here. This is why I neither seek nor demand loyalty from mine followers, for my power is not that of belief, but of life.
The only thing that couldst disrupt mine energies wouldst be the extinction of all life upon this realm, in which case I wouldst be forced from this realm to find another. I would never allow such an abomination against balance to occur here.

I hath good news for thee, for the strength of the language known as Java is that it doth operate upon its own structure, so that it is universally understood by all, no matter what their native language may be.
Thus it is that a man known as Windows may speak happily with a man known as Macintosh, by speaking in Java, despite each being born knowing a different language. It is a universal language for all; this is one of it''s major strengths.

There are at least twenty deities who didst force themselves upon this realm whilst I slumbered, Saradomin and Zamorak are the two who hath most prominence amongst the general populace.

As to thy query regarding the histories of the library, I hath knowledge that such an addition is indeed planned, but treacherous Zamorak takes strange delight in the torture of the man responsible, Reldo.
This puzzles me greatly, for he hath never struck me as anything more than a mild mannered creature devoted solely to the studies of scholarship.

---

> Tell me... you claim to be the god the represents balance, like in neutrality. And you name is Guthix. But from the moment you have a name, you aren''t neutral anymore. In the last letter you told zidane\_909 : "I am beyond good or evil, I am simply Guthix." That''s means you chose or like the name yourself. So you aren''t neutral, because you favor something.

A name means nothing other than the meaning that ist placed upon it.
Mine name means nothing in of itself; it is simply the closest thing to my true name that ist possible in the language of man.
To pronounce mine true name correctly I wouldst have to remove thy vocal cords.

Each god receives questions in the magnitude of hundreds daily, and usually more directly following the publication of their responses.
Although many are received and all are read, only a few are selected for response - thou will probably be glad to know, for thou art known to us as a quizzical thinker Lord Duckman, and although thy many questions are not necessarily answered, they all reach their destination.

As to thy query regarding the co-operation of Saradomin and Zamorak with myself upon a letters response, I fear that making the two arch-enemies co-operate upon anything, even something as minor as responding to their followers, is a task beyond even my powers...
...and I personally find clowns to be unfunny bufoons who willst degrade their lives for an attempt at a cheap laugh; but I am not known for my sense of humour.

<p class="rsc-centre-text"><em>Coolpitcher</em></p>

The world shall remain the same, yet will also be changed. Continents, seas, rivers, mountains and cities shall remain similar to their existing selves, yet shall be different enough to briefly disorient those who rely on existing landmarks for direction.
I hath already claimed the restoration of this world will be total, from each blade of grass, to the highest mountain - and my claim was not made with exaggeration.

> Truly you are a mighty god, but I am quite confused. In his first letters, Sardomin said that HE created Runescape. In your first letter (thankfully I got to hear from the third god) though, you said YOU created Runescape. Who is puffing themselves up, and who is lying, I wonder? I used to be a follower of Sardomin, but now I doubt my ways. Am I to be a follower of you, of Zamorak, or stay the way I am? Or to be an atheist? Or is that the way of Guthix (to be atheist)? And how would I know if YOU were the one puffing himself up?... :\ Meep. My head hurts now.

*-Blast-chan*

I claim not the creation of Gielinor; I claim it''s rightful ownership, for none other dwelled here when first I arrived.
I knowst not why Saradomin would claim otherwise, other than in a bid for glory, for all other gods came to this plane whilst I slumbered.

> I wouldst like to ask thee some questions concerning the dwarves, and their mine. ''Twas my understanding that dwarven smiths were the greatest in all runescape, and that their skill in metalworking was rivaled only by their fondness of being alone. These facts dist lead me to wonder, where is their furnace? Surely they do not journey all the way to Falador merely to smelt the ore that they so diligently mine, and trek back again to hammer it? If that is indeed the case then they canst turn themselves invisible for I have never seen one in the city. I understand that it would be too easy to train smithing if all citizens of runescape had access to dwarven furnaces, but could they not be persuaded to grant us use if we completed a quest for them?

<p class="rsc-centre-text"><a href="/images/dwarf-superheat-item.jpg"><img class="rsc-image" src="/images/dwarf-superheat-item.jpg" /></a></p>

Dwarves learn the magick known as ''superheat item'' at a young age, for it removes the uncertainty involved with smelting ores in the more conventional manner, and doth improve their productivity.

As such they hath no need for furnaces.

I do anything and everything necessary to maintain balance - it is a far more time consuming occupation than might first be considered.

> Guthix, it''s clear that the Druids follow you and your philosophy of balance (if it can be called a philosophy rather than a lack of one...confusing).
> But what about Chaos Druids? The beastiary informs me that they follow the dual philosophies of you and Zamorak, but I''m a bit unclear on how that would be possible. Neutral, but not neutral? Evil, but not evil? What''s your thoughts?

*Haldir2012*

 The chaos druids acknowledge mine position as the eldest and most powerful deity, and still strive for my ultimate aim of balance upon this land; but unlike the more passive actions taken by their non-chaotic brethren, they take an active role in culling this land of the more prolific species which inhabit it.

Man is the most prolific race that dwelleth upon this realm, and it is mankind that they take most pleasure in dispatching.
This is also an aim of Zamoraks, and so they doth serve two masters through striving for this one goal.

*Mr. Beef Wellington*

> P.S. Do you have to talk so wierd?? I can barely understand you!

I am balance, not neutrality - neutrality doth suggest inaction, when the oposite is the truth. I willst take ANY action necessary to ensure balance upon mine plane, and as such, mine actions canst be deemed to be good or evil depending on howst they affect thee. In truth, they are neither - they art merely necessary.

As to the ''weirdness'' of mine language: the language of man is not native to myself, and hast changed greatly since last I had use for it.
I canst not express myself clearer than this, for thine language is both alien and strange to me.

<p class="rsc-centre-text"><em>Follower of all gods....</em></p>

I beg to differ with thy experience in combat.
Often do I see skilled warriors attack each other, yet hit at a bad angle and provide merely a glancing blow that causes no damage, or have their attack slighted due to armour: rarely do I see a warrior with any weapons training utterly miss an opponent at close range...

*From No1Stoney, (A Very Confused Player)*

The beings that thou speak of are not wholly tied to this realm; they flitter between the dimensions like butterflies across a meadow. When thou slay them, thou force their remains into one dimension alone; this one.

As long as they are alive they canst remain incorporeal, but once their fate hast been decided and they hath died they canst no longer travel between realms as they could when they were alive.

They art tendrils, not ''wires'' - and I require them.
As to your boasts of your battle prowess being great enough to defeat the terrible Delrith without mine assistance, I say to you: drop thy Silverlight, for it is a sword endowed with power by myself.
Then perhaps thou willst see the assistance which hath been offered to thee.

---

I hath just enough time to answer a few quick questions, for maintaining the balance of this world is a time-consuming job.

tyy32 asks *"Why are the magic runes used only once per rune?"* - Each rune is a man made stone which hath been endowed with a magical charge, yet just enough charge for one use only.

~Bryan00~ says that *"andrew has too much imagination"* to which I respond: ''Tis better to have a surplus than a deficit is it not?

The Fuzz200 enquires *"When the new grapics come out can you equip fishing items?(i.e. fishing rods)"* - I can assure thee that such is indeed the case.

an anonymous request *"Hey guthix where would i download runescape?"*;
If thou meanst the client, I am assured that what thou art looking for is located [HERE](#TODO).

Tc Olam would like a clarification as to whether or not *"this rumour that masks increase your levels by 10 depending on colour is true?"* - my response is that this is a baseless rumour.
One of far too many, unfortunately.

"B.I." would like to know *"Will monsters have the ability to cast spells or shoot at us?"*
Most assuredly... it is a necessary balance to counter that they may now be swarmed by a mob...

Hello once more glorious Saradominists!

Most shopkeepers make a very good living from the day to day sale of small and insignificant items such as pots, buckets and hammers, which they buy in bulk and then sell individually for extremely healthy mark ups - yet all shop keepers dream of the famous day when a party hat was sold to them for a mere 2 gold.

Well, I''m slightly surprised you used your chance to contact me with a childish riddle, but the answer is that the driver would be the same at the end of the journey as he was at the start.

In other words, the driver would still be the glorious Saradomin - but I have a question of my own for you;

What exactly is a ''bus''?

*Your almost faithful follower, mage girl 89*

Cost cutting exercises by the First National Bank of RuneScape meant many branch closures of the smaller, local banks some years back.
It is somewhat unfortunate, but all newcomers from Tutorial Island have access to a bank before reaching the mainland, where they can ensure their meagre posessions are secure, and the large town of Varrock which is but a small journey from Lumbridge has not one but two large branches of the bank, available for all.

One of the questions are, when the big 3d update come up, well you be able to some items from another when other players have them equiped. Ex.

You cannot wear them, or use them for anything important. Also, I am sure that you know Andrew? I am not trying to be mean in this way, but sometime''s it seems that he has favorism for the higher level people? It just came up in a discussion with my friend, Psycho39k.

I have good news for you, for in the new version of the world you can indeed see exactly what weaponry and armour another player is wearing, for each will look different enough to be obvious at a glance. Similarly, You will also be able to wear any rings that you choose to.
I also agree that everyone should be treated equally, and can assure you the Mage Andrew does not favour higher leveled players over others.

He hates you all, and tries to make all your lives equally miserable... just kidding! Andrew, please punish not my followers in retaliation!

If you can find some kind soul to escort you past the dangers of White Wolf mountain the first time, you will find a shortcut through the dwarven passages that will save you from being harrassed by the dangers of the mountain afterwards.
He may of course require some small favour in return for access to this passage...

Alternatively, you may prefer to take the pleasant scenic route by boat to Karamja, and then transfer to take the equally picturesque boat journey from Brimhaven back to the mainland.

You will almost certainly be glad to hear that the ever popular, and exceedingly useful, Tutorial Island will remain in place after the upgrade, for all newcomers to the world of RuneScape to gain some knowledge of the land before being set loose upon the general populace.
For those who are already wise to the ways of the world of RuneScape, they will not find the control system so different as to be unfamiliar to them, and should be able to re-adjust themselves very quickly to the new scheme of things.

*-Llun of Lhun*

As a pedant you should feel glad that I will correct you in pointing out that lack of apostrophes is an error in punctuation, not of spelling.
The mistake is, of course, not mine, for mighty Saradomin is never in error - rather it is the fault of the cheap dwarven labour employed by the Council who are responsible for typesetting and printing these responses.

So there.

I have some small queries which I will answer briefly, before leaving you once more;

TKDFighter asks me *"Why can''t 2H swords have their own shop?"* - I am sure you will be glad to know that such a shop does indeed exist...
and suggest you search a little more thoroughly in future...

Obie\_Trice10 asks *"what music u like???"* - to which my only answer is that I enjoy nothing more than the Psalms and Hymns of my temples, extolling my virtues and glories for all to hear.

It is, literally, music to mine ears.

Desecration would like to know *"y r u the god of goodness?"*
Because the god of spelling, grammar and punctuation was already taken.
I don''t think he does his job very well.

*"Why is the lesser Demon in wizard tower locked up?"* asks Night Hawk04; My only reply is that it is because it would be extremely dangerous for the wizards if he was allowed to roam free.

And finally, an anonymous request would like to know *"Do you have a number that I could call?*" - No. I ABSOLUTELY do not.

My work here for the time being is done... and so I must depart once more.
